 /*MAP => It is implemented using Binary Search Tree 
 All operations are of O(log n) time as all operatins are performed on BST 
 
 unordered_map => It is implemented using a hash table where data are marked using a hash function.
 
The key value pair is stored in two forms 
1. Closed addressing => It is a method where the elements when have the same hash are placed in next free space.

a. Linear Probing when the vacant position is searched linearly.
b. Quadratic probing when the vacant positions are searched quadraticly.

Disadvantage = > Clustering i.e a lot of elements are placed near one location and most of the spaces are unoccupied.

2. Open Chaining  => This is a method used to place the elements in a link list that is placed at an array location.
After finding the hashed position we then do linear search and find the element. */

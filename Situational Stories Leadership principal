In my first year of college there was subject called computer programming and numerical method where we had a lab assessement in whcih we were given a task to program 
something out of the box. They had recently briefed us about switch statements and basics of oops concepts and function.

So I had a time span of two days before which I had to complete the task . I was playing tic tac toe game on my computer online and suddenly came up with an idea that 
whether or not it is possible to create 1v1 game using what I had learned. The curosity was so high that it made go through a lot of gfg articles about and a lot of youtube
videos to understand how optimally I can use oops concept to reuse the same code so that I need not write same code again and again.

I also studied about cls and goto command that can help me clearing screen and navigate through different code segments easily. I wrote the code in such a way that
all 9 cells of board were marked with different charecters and a user pressed the charecter the program would replace the charecter with 'X' or 'O' as per user's code
and the program would clear the screen and then print the updated board. It would also check for a possible winner after each input and if there was a winner it would 
return the user id and print "Winner Winner".

On the next lab day I showed the code to my lab teacher. He was very happy to see the process I went thought to create this game and asked me to present this to teacher 
eventually I was asked to submit this as my project for the subject of that semester.

For my project of Code Saver App I wanted to implement forget password feature as users often forget their password and wouldn't be able to login. Since there can be 
important questions with important notes that they might have saved for future revison , this feature was necessary to secure and saveguard their information.

My task was to find how can I implement this feature that would help me in sending an email from the server to the user's email id smoothly. Also my task was to select 
the best email cloud service that would help me in email delivery service.

After going through the node js documentation I came to know about nodemailer module that helps in sending the email. After reading about the module I went through some 
videos I learnt how to implement it . Then I started researching about the various email delivery service provider and came to know about Send Grid, Mail Chimp and Amazon
SES (Simple Email Service). After a lot of consideration and reasearch on youtube and reading articles I came to conclusin that later two are mostly used for bulk email
marketing whereas Send Grid is more developer friendly and it thrives more on technical use cases.

The resetpassword was successfully implemented and it has been used extensively from then ownwards to secure the data.

A situation occered in the company(Wobot.AI) that I am Interning where there was a project that had to be tested and finalized within friday. But on Wedensday
we came to know that two memebers from the data annotation team had an emergency and they had taken a leave.

The project was important and time bound so my manager asked me if I could two jobs parallely.
